Using the resources various machine learning algorithms can be learned to be implemented using python libraries.
The .ipynb are machine learning and pandas files that we are learning and the learnings will be useful it the project. The machine learning files basically include the decision tree, randomforest and the k-fold classification algorithms implemented.
The pandas file includes an exploratory data analysis project.
